Managed Heap---->
Garbage Collector------> collecting all the resources of all the resources which are not used for a long period of time.


Generations of the Objects/Lifetime of the object:

Gen 0: Most newly created/marked as gen0 on the heap----Most frequently garbage collected.
Gen 1: Reuse of the object will give a increment on the Gen 1/on the heap--Gen1--Less frequently
garbage collected.
Gen 2: More reuse shifts the object to gen2----are very rarely garbage collected.
Only be garbage Collected if they are not used/Dispose or the newly coming object need space on the heap, at the same time when the objects are not used.
